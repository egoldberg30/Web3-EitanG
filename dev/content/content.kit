    <h3>During the pandemic, our wonderful Mutter Museum staff took the opportunity to do a deep clean on all of our displays! Our shiny glass cases reaffirm our commitment to bring you as close as possible to our wonderful specimen. We were also lucky enough to receive some new donated artifacts, which will be on display very soon. To learn more about the newest additions to our collection, check out our <a href="#">Exhibits</a> tab!</h3>
